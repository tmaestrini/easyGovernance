## üëâ Before you start

In order to help us process your contributions, please make sure you do the following:

- don't surprise us with big PR's. Instead create an issue & start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- create your branch from `dev` (NOT `main`). This will make it easier for us to merge your changes.
- submit PR to the `dev` branch of this repo (NOT `main`). PRs submitted to other branches will be declined.
- let us know what's in the PR: sometimes code is not enough and in order to help us understand your awesome work please follow the PR template to provide required information.
- don't commit code you didn't write.

Do not be afraid to ask question. We are here to help you succeed in helping us making a better product.
