      - SharingCapability: "Forcing guest authentication on the organization's tenant enables the implementation of controls and oversight over external file sharing. When a guest is registered with the organization, they now have an identity which can be accounted for."
      - DefaultSharingLinkType: "By defaulting to specific people, the user will first need to consider whether or not the content being shared should be accessible by the entire organization versus select individuals. This aids in reinforcing the concept of least privilege."
      - ExternalUserExpirationRequired: "This setting ensures that guests who no longer need access to the site or link no longer have access after a set period of time. Allowing guest access for a longer or an indefinite amount of time could lead to loss of data confidentiality and oversight."
      - EmailAttestationReAuthDays: "This setting configures if guests who use a verification code to access the site or links are required to reauthenticate after a set number of days. It should be set to '15' or les days."
      - PreventExternalUsersFromResharing: "The organization should have the authority over what external users get shared with to prevent unauthorized disclosures of information."
      - SharingAllowedDomainList: "Refer to the section 'More external sharing settings' on ${{tenantAdminUrl}}/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/sharing. Restricting the domains that users can share documents with will reduce the risk of unauthorized access to company data."
      - CoreRequestFilesLinkEnabled: "This setting depends on the setting in 'Sharing Capability'. Setting the value to 'true' has no effect as long as 'Sharing Capability' is set to 'ExistingExternalUserSharingOnly'."

      - EnableAzureADB2BIntegration: "This provides a way to manage guest identities and control access to SharePoint and OneDrive resources. Without this integration, files can only be shared without account registration, making it more challenging to audit and manage who has access to the organization's data."
