## Report Summary
_easyGovernance_ validates several configurations and resources along predefined _configuration baselines_ for the Microsoft 365 tenant %{Tenant} and dedicated services.
Any _configuration baseline_ is considered to reference the baseline suggestions from the [Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) for Microsoft 365](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project) by CISA and [the blueprint](https://blueprint.oobe.com.au/blueprint/) by oobe.
All configuration parameters that are used in the configuration baselines provide a standard and proven approach for Microsoft 365 but can be extended according to your needs.
